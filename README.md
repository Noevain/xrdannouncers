# XrdAnnouncers

Complete UE4 source code for https://gamebanana.com/sounds/62906, when cooking for release delete the SoundClasses folder so the sound cues can use the game provided ones.
I've had to recreate the project from scratch due to losing the original source files so there might be some small discrepancies with the original, you can report any bugs/requests in Issues

# Credits
This mod would not be possible without [The sounds resource website](https://www.sounds-resource.com/pc_computer/guiltygearxrdsign/) huge thanks to [Ulthev](https://www.sounds-resource.com/submitter/Ulthev/) for ripping the announcers voicelines from Xrd
